# Student Performance Prediction using Linear Regression(Machine Learning)

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a simple Linear Regression model using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) in Python for the [Student Performance Dataset(Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression?resource=download). Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. There are many factors in the dataset that determine the student's performance.

## Features

- **Simple Implementation:** The model is implemented using scikit-learn, making it easy to understand and use.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Explore and visualize the model in action through the included Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage

- This project can be used as learning and referrence medium for beginners.
- Advance version of the project can be developed using this repository as a template/blueprint.

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akankshmakam/Student-Performance-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
cd Student-Performance-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
```

## Jupyter Notebook
Explore the provided Jupyter Notebook (Student Performance Prediction-Linear Regression.ipynb) for a detailed walkthrough of the model, including data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
